2.0 LICENSE GRANT. 
2.1 SDK License.
A. Provided Licensee pays to Avaya the applicable license fee (if any), Avaya hereby grants Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, license (without the right to sublicense, except as set forth in 2.1B(iii)) to use the SDK (including Sample Application Code) solely for the purpose of Licensee's internal development efforts to develop applications, interfaces, value-added services and/or solutions, workflows or processes to work in conjunction with Avaya products provided, however, that Licensee shall have no right to distribute, license (whether or not through multiple tiers) or otherwise transfer the SDK to any third party or incorporate the SDK in any software, product, or technology. Avaya further grants Licensee the right, if the Licensee so chooses, to package Client Libraries for redistribution with Licensee’s complementary applications that have been developed using this SDK, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein. Where SDK includes Specification Document(s), Licensee is granted a license to use such Specification Documents solely to enable Licensee’s products, services and application solutions to exchange messages and signals with Avaya products, systems and solutions to which the Specification Document(s) apply. Avaya’s support obligations for the SDK, Sample Application Code and any Derivative Works are set forth in Section 4 of this Agreement.  
B. The foregoing license to use Sample Application Code is contingent upon the following: (i) Licensee may use and modify the Sample Application Code, Specification Documents and Documentation solely for internal development of applications, interfaces, workflows or processes for use with Avaya products, integration of such applications, interfaces, workflows and processes with Avaya products and interoperability testing of the foregoing with Avaya products, (ii) Licensee must ensure that the modifications made to the Sample Application Code as permitted in clause (i) of this Section 2.1B are compatible and/or interoperable with Avaya products and/or integrated therewith, (iii) Licensee may compile or otherwise prepare for distribution the Sample Application Code with Permitted Modifications, into an object code or other suitable program format for distribution, provided that such sublicense is subject to an end user license agreement that is consistent with the terms of this Agreement and, if applicable, the Avaya DevConnect Program Agreement, and is equally as protective as Licensee’s standard software license terms, but in no event shall the standard of care be less than a reasonable degree of care.  Under no circumstances shall Licensee enable the use or activation of any of Avaya’s Intellectual Property by an end user, without such end user having acquired the additional necessary licenses to Avaya Intellectual Property. Avaya’s support obligations for the SDK, Sample Application Code and any Derivative Works are set forth in Section 4 of this Agreement. 
C. Except as expressly authorized by this Agreement, and unless otherwise permitted by the applicable law, Licensee shall not: (i) translate, publish, or display the SDK, Specification Documents or Documentation or any copy or part thereof; or (ii) use, modify, or distribute the redistributable Client Libraries in any manner that causes any portion of the redistributable Client Libraries that is not already subject to an OSS license to become subject to the terms of any OSS license.
D. Licensee agrees that it is licensed to use the SDK only in connection with Avaya products (and if applicable, in connection with services provided under the Avaya DevConnect Program Agreement). In the event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Avaya DevConnect Program Agreement (if applicable), the terms and conditions of the Avaya DevConnect Program Agreement shall prevail. 
E. With respect to Software that contains elements provided by third party suppliers, Licensee may install and use the Software in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable license agreements, such as “shrinkwrap” or “click-through” licenses, accompanying or applicable to the Software.
F. Avaya shall have the right, at its cost and expense, to inspect and/or audit (i) by remote polling or other reasonable electronic means at any time and (ii) in person during normal business hours and with reasonable notice Licensee’s books, records, and accounts, to determine Licensee’s compliance with this Agreement.  In the event such inspection or audit uncovers non-compliance with this Agreement, then without prejudice to Avaya’s termination rights hereunder, Licensee shall promptly pay Avaya any applicable license fees.  Licensee agrees to keep a current record of the location of the SDK.
2.2 No Standalone Product.  Nothing in this Agreement authorizes or grants Licensee any rights to distribute or otherwise make available to a third party the SDK, in whole or in part, or any Derivative Work in source or object code format on a standalone basis other than the modifications permitted in Section 2.1B of this Agreement.
2.3 Proprietary Notices.  Licensee shall not remove any copyright, trade mark or other proprietary notices incorporated in the copies of the SDK, Sample Application Code and redistributable files in Licensee’s possession or control or any modifications thereto. Redistributions in binary form or other suitable program format for distribution, to the extent expressly permitted, must also reproduce Avaya’s copyright, trade marks or other proprietary notices as incorporated in the SDK in any associated Documentation or “splash screens” that display Licensee copyright notices.  
2.4 Third-Party Components.  You acknowledge certain software programs or portions thereof included in the SDK may contain software distributed under third party agreements (“Third Party Components”), which may contain terms that expand or limit rights to use certain portions of the SDK (“Third Party Terms”). Information identifying the copyright holders of the Third Party Components and the Third Party Terms that apply is available in the attached Schedule 1 (if any), SDK, Documentation, or on Avaya’s web site at: http://support.avaya.com/Copyright (or such successor site as designated by Avaya).  The open source software license terms provided as Third Party Terms are consistent with the license rights granted in this Agreement, and may contain additional rights benefiting You, such as modification and distribution of the open source software.  The Third Party Terms shall take precedence over this Agreement, solely with respect to the applicable Third Party Components, to the extent that this Agreement imposes greater restrictions on You than the applicable Third Party Terms.  Licensee is solely responsible for procuring any necessary licenses for Third Party Components, including payment of licensing royalties or other amounts to third parties, for the use thereof.
2.5 Copies of SDK.  Licensee may copy the SDK only as necessary to exercise its rights hereunder; provided, however that Licensee may also make one (1) copy for back-up purposes and any reproduction of the SDK (including derivatives thereof), either in whole or in part, shall include the Avaya copyright notice that was provided in the SDK. 
2.6 No Reverse Engineering.  Licensee shall have no rights to any Source Code for any of the software in the SDK, except for the explicit rights to use the Source Code as provided to Licensee hereunder. Licensee agrees that it shall not cause or permit the disassembly, decompilation or reverse engineering of the Software. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the SDK is rightfully located in a member state of the European Union and Licensee needs information about the Software in the SDK in order to achieve interoperability of an independently created software program with the Software in the SDK, Licensee will first request such information from Avaya. Avaya may charge Licensee a reasonable fee for the provision of such information. If Avaya refuses to make such information available, then Licensee may take steps, such as reverse assembly or reverse compilation, to the extent necessary solely in order to achieve interoperability of the Software in the SDK with an independently created software program. To the extent that the Licensee is expressly permitted by applicable mandatory law to undertake any of the activities listed in this section, Licensee will not exercise those rights until Licensee has given Avaya twenty (20) days written notice of its intent to exercise any such rights.
2.7 Responsibility for Development Tools.  Licensee acknowledges that effective utilization of the SDK may require the use of a development tool, compiler and other software and technology of third parties, which may be incorporated in the SDK pursuant to Section 2.4. Licensee is solely responsible for procuring such third party software and technology and the necessary licenses, including payment of licensing royalties or other amounts to third parties, for the use thereof. 
2.8 U.S. Government End Users.  The SDK shall be classified as "commercial computer software" and the Documentation is classified as "commercial computer software documentation" or "commercial items," pursuant to FAR 12.212 or DFAR 227.7202, as applicable. Any use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display or disclosure of the SDK or Documentation by the Government of the United States shall be governed solely by the terms of the Agreement and shall be prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by the terms of the Agreement.
2.9 Limitation of Rights.  No right is granted to Licensee to sublicense its rights hereunder. All rights not expressly granted are reserved by Avaya and, except as expressly set forth herein, no license is granted by Avaya under this Agreement directly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, under any patent, copyright, trade secret or trademark or other Intellectual Property right of Avaya. Nothing herein shall be deemed to authorize Licensee to use Avaya's trademarks or trade names in Licensee's advertising, marketing, promotional, sales or related materials.
2.10 Nonassertion by Licensee.  Licensee agrees not to assert any patent rights related to the SDK or applications developed using the SDK against Avaya, Avaya's distributors, Avaya customers, or other licensees of the SDK for making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing any products or technology developed using the SDK. 
2.11 Avaya Independent Development.  Licensee understands and agrees that Avaya or its Affiliates may acquire, license, develop for itself or have others develop for it, and market and/or distribute similar software to that which Licensee may develop. In absence of a separate written agreement to the contrary, Avaya or its Affiliates will be free to use any information Licensee provides, including problem reports or enhancement requests, to Avaya for any purpose, subject to any applicable patents or copyrights.
2.12 Feedback and Support.  Licensee agrees to provide any comments and suggestions regarding the performance of the SDK (a) if applicable, on the developer forum of the DevConnect Program on www.avaya.com/devconnect; or (b) via the process otherwise indicated by Avaya with respect to the SDK.  Avaya agrees to monitor the applicable forum but is under no obligation to implement any of the suggestions and/or proposals, or be required to respond to any questions asked in the forum. Self-support tools are available via the Avaya DevConnect program’s portal and requires self registration. Licensee hereby assigns to Avaya all right, title, and interest in and to Feedback provided to Avaya.  
2.13 Fees and Taxes.  To the extent that fees are associated with the license of the SDK, Licensee agrees to pay to Avaya or pay directly to the applicable government or taxing authority, if requested by Avaya, all taxes and charges, including without limitation, penalties and interest, which may be imposed by any federal, state or local governmental or taxing authority arising hereunder excluding, however, all taxes computed upon Avaya’s net income. If You move any Software, including the SDK, and as a result of such move, a jurisdiction imposes a duty, tax, levy or fee (including withholding taxes, fees, customs or other duties for the import and export of any such Software), then You are solely liable for, and agree to pay, any such duty, taxes, levy or other fees.
2.14 No Endorsement.  Neither the name Avaya, its Affiliates nor the names of contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from the Avaya SDK without specific prior written permission from Avaya.
2.15 High Risk Activities.  The Avaya SDK is not fault-tolerant, and is not designed, manufactured or intended for use or resale as on-line control equipment or in hazardous environments requiring failsafe performance, such as in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or aircraft communications systems, mass transit, air traffic control, medical or direct life support machines, dedicated emergency call handling systems or weapons systems, in which the failure of the Avaya SDK could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage ("high risk activities"). If Licensee uses the Avaya SDK for high risk activities, Licensee does so at Licensee’s own risk and Licensee assumes all responsibility and liability for such use to the maximum extent such limitation or exclusion is permitted by applicable law. Licensee agrees that Avaya and its suppliers will not be liable for any claims or damages arising from or related to use of the Avaya SDK for high risk activities to the maximum extent such limitation or exclusion is permitted by law. 
2.16 No Virus.  Licensee warrants that (i) the applications, interfaces, value-added services and/or solutions, workflows or processes Licensee develops using this SDK will not contain any computer program file that includes time code limitations, disabling devices, or any other mechanism which will prevent the Supplier Software from being functional at all times (collectively “Time Bombs”); and (ii) the applications, interfaces, value-added services and/or solutions, workflows or processes Licensee develops using this SDK will be free of computer viruses, black boxes, malware, trapdoors, and other mechanisms to allow remote/hidden attacks or access through unauthorized computerized command and control, and will not contain any other computer software routines designed to spy, monitor traffic (network sniffers, keyloggers), damage or erase such applications, interfaces, value-added services and/or solutions, workflows or processes developed using this SDK or data, or any computer files or systems of Avaya, its Affiliates, and/or end users (collectively “Virus”). In addition to any other remedies permitted in the Agreement, if Licensee breaches its warranties under this Section, Licensee will, at its expense, take remedial action to eliminate any Time Bombs and/or Viruses and prevent re-occurrence (including implementing appropriate processes to prevent further occurrences) as well as provide prompt, reasonable assistance to Avaya to materially reduce the effects of the Time Bomb and/or Virus.
2.17 Disclaimer. Any software security feature is not a guaranty against malicious code, deleterious routines, and other techniques and tools employed by computer “hackers” and other third parties to create security exposures. Compromised passwords represent a major security risk. Avaya encourages You to create strong passwords using three different character types, change Your password regularly and refrain from using the same password regularly. You must treat such information as confidential. You agree to notify Avaya immediately upon becoming aware of any unauthorized use or breach of Your user name, password, account, or subscription. You are responsible for ensuring that Your networks and systems are adequately secured against unauthorized intrusion or attack and regularly back up of Your data and files in accordance with good computing practices.

13.0 WAIVER.
The failure to assert any rights under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the right to terminate in the event of breach or default, will not be deemed to constitute a waiver of the right to enforce each and every provision of this Agreement in accordance with their terms. 
14.0 SEVERABILITY.
If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be unenforceable or invalid, this Agreement will not be rendered unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and the provision will be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the original provision within the limits of applicable law. 
15.0 GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
This Agreement and any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement ("Dispute"), including without limitation those relating to the formation, interpretation, breach or termination of this Agreement, or any issue regarding whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration under this Agreement, will be governed by New York State laws, excluding conflict of law principles, and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. 
Any Dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the following provisions. The disputing party shall give the other party written notice of the Dispute. The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve each Dispute within thirty (30) days, or such other longer period as the parties may mutually agree, following the delivery of such notice, by negotiations between designated representatives of the parties who have dispute resolution authority. If a Dispute that arose anywhere other than in the United States or is based upon an alleged breach committed anywhere other than in the United States cannot be settled under these procedures and within these timeframes, it will be conclusively determined upon request of either party by a final and binding arbitration proceeding to be held in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by a single arbitrator appointed by the parties or (failing agreement) by an arbitrator appointed by the President of the International Chamber of Commerce (from time to time), except that if the aggregate claims, cross claims and counterclaims by any one party against any or all other parties exceed One Million US Dollars at the time all claims, including cross claims and counterclaims are filed, the proceeding will be held in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by a panel of three arbitrator(s) appointed in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language, at a location agreed by the parties or (failing agreement) ordered by the arbitrator(s). The arbitrator(s) will have authority only to award compensatory damages within the scope of the limitations of this Agreement and will not award punitive or exemplary damages. The arbitrator(s) will not have the authority to limit, expand or otherwise modify the terms of this Agreement. The ruling by the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on the parties and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties or any of their assets. The parties will evenly split the cost of the arbitrator(s)' fees, but each party will bear its own attorneys' fees and other costs associated with the arbitration. The parties, their representatives, other participants and the arbitrator(s) will hold the existence, content and results of the arbitration in strict confidence to the fullest extent permitted by law. Any disclosure of the existence, content and results of the arbitration shall be as limited and narrowed as required to comply with the applicable law. By way of illustration, if the applicable law mandates the disclosure of the monetary amount of an arbitration award only, the underlying opinion or rationale for that award may not be disclosed. 
If a Dispute by one party against the other that arose in the United States or is based upon an alleged breach committed in the United States cannot be settled under the procedures and within the timeframe set forth above, then either party may bring an action or proceeding solely in either the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Except as otherwise stated above with regard to arbitration of Disputes that arise anywhere other than in the United States or are based upon an alleged breach committed anywhere other than in the United States, each party to this Agreement consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts, including their appellate courts, for the purpose of all actions and proceedings.
The parties agree that the arbitration provision in this section may be enforced by injunction or other equitable order, and no bond or security of any kind will be required with respect to any such injunction or order. Nothing in this section will be construed to preclude either party from seeking provisional remedies, including but not limited to temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions from any court of competent jurisdiction in order to protect its rights, including its rights pending arbitration, at any time. In addition and notwithstanding the foregoing, Avaya shall be entitled to take any necessary legal action at any time, including without limitation seeking immediate injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction, in order to protect Avaya's intellectual property and its confidential or proprietary information (including but not limited to trade secrets).
16.0 IMPORT/EXPORT CONTROL.
Licensee is advised that the SDK is of U.S. origin and subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”).
